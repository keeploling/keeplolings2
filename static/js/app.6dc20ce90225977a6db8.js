If I am focusing on CS-ing, then I find it challenging to also poke the enemy.

The dragon always seems to be quite contested in the beginning of the game.</p>\n            <p>I do want to note that I am by no means amazing at playing any computer games, but I do enjoy playing them and I do want to get better at playing them.</p>\n            <p>After almost half a year of playing ranked, I have definitely had my up's and down's with this mode.
